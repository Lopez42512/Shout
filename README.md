## Creating a shout
Shout! takes two considerations when you're shouting: location and activity.  When you land on the page we ask for your your location.  Then, when you shout,the location pin with your shout is dropped letting you know you are live and shouting.  This means when your friends enter your radius, or if they are in your radius, they will see your Shout!

## Messaging
Shout offers a quick messaging system to inititate a conversation between the shouter and the friend.  This way you can both decided what to do.

## YELP
Shout! also offers Yelp's business search services, for the shouters that don't know what to do.
